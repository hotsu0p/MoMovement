# Welcome!

## What is this mod and what does it do?
This is just a small mod i coded for minecraft to add more movement / parkor because i wanted to. 

It adds vaulting, wall-running , vaulting (In alpha still) , rolling (Which can cancle fall damage if timed right), also Ledge grabbing, and sliding.

## How do i use it?
Well once you have it installed go the controls menu and you have to bind mo-movment up and down (See the image below)
